His zeal to serve the people and make an impact for the masses led him to join the All India Youth Federation when he was in his late teens and through his involvement in that, he later noticed the kind of troubles children were facing and he revived Bala Sangham in 1985 and served as the president of that till 2011. From his early days as a child rights activist, Achyuta Rao was extremely active, rescuing hundreds of children from the clutches of begging mafia, child labour and more.",
